# Real Time Bus Tracker 
<img src="PreviewImage.png">


# Description
This is my MIT coursework project, that tracks the current location of MBTA BUS Route 1 between MIT and Harvard campus using mapbox as the mapping platform and accessing live bus gps information from the MBTA API. The MBTA bus data is used to determine stops between MIT and Harvard with an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes and displays live locations of the busses on a map.

# How to Run
Try it out live at https://github.com/ggmziray/Real-TimeBusTracker

# Roadmap of Future Improvements
1.) Customization
2.) Adding more locations & markers
3.) Improving functionality 
4.) Creating a visual bus schedule & alerts for when a bus is coming
